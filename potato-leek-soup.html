    <h2>A comforting and creamy soup for cold winter days</h2>
    <p>A tasty and warming way to get all the nutrients you need during the winter months.</p>
    <p>The consistency is not too thick and not too thin, just enough to coat the back of a spoon.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 leeks, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups water</li>
            <li>2 pounds potatoes, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>⅜ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks in hot oil until completely softened, adding remaining olive oil in small amounts as you cook the leeks, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour vegetable broth and water into the pot; add potatoes. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are completely tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour potato mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Stir cayenne pepper and salt into the soup.</li>
    </ol>
